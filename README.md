Project Switcher for WAMP
==================
Switch root `www` directories easily without renaming folders

## Usage

Move `projectswitch.bat` or `bin/projectswitch.exe` to WAMP installation directory (ex: C:\wamp) and run. Program will automatically create `webx` folder, where you will store your root directories.

**Example:** You have two different projects (websites) `my-website` and `project1`. You have `project1` files in your www folder. So if you want to run `my-website` on localhost, you are replacing source www folder's source files.
